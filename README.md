# Data Science for Public Health: Machine Learning

This repository contains code and resources for data preprocessing, classification, and regression machine learning models in the field of public health. The models are created and analyzed using Python libraries such as scikit-learn, pandas, and numpy.

## Introduction

We explore various machine learning techniques applied to public health datasets. The goal is to develop models that can predict and analyze health-related outcomes based on available data.
